Structures' Compass a Minecraft Forge mod allows player to quickly locate a specific [structure](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Generated_structures).

This mod is inspired by [Nature's Compass](https://github.com/MattCzyr/NaturesCompass), and part of our code is from their mod.

## Features
- Sneak + right click with the Structures' Compass in hand to open the searching GUI.
  - search structure's name directly
  - search structure's source by starting with '@'
  - search structure's available dimensions by starting with '#'
- Right click to search the selected structure again.
- When the compass is not pointing at a structure, or the structure is in another dimension, 
  it will point at random position, just like the normal compass in the Nether or the End. 
- The compass supports all registered structures (vanilla and modded).

## Recipe

![Recipe](docs/images/Recipe.png)

4 of any dead coral at 4 corners, 4 of mossy stone bricks at 4 edges and 1 compass at the center

We think the compass is too op, so we increase the crafting difficulty to balance it.

~~**v1.1.0**: Now you can change the config to use iron bars instead of dead corals~~
(deprecated in **v1.2.0** because of bug [#8](https://github.com/Samarium150/StructuresCompass/issues/8))

## Further Development

We're too busy to develop, so we just list some possibilities
- [ ] Port to another version like 1.12.2
- [ ] Port to Fabric

## Contribute

Structures and dimensions don't have localized names by default. 
If you see something like `structure.<modid>.<name>` in the GUI or HUD, that essentially means there is not localized name for it.
If you would like to add translations, 
create corresponding JSON files under [`resources/assets/<modid>/lang/`](/src/main/resources/assets) and send Pull Requests to us. 
We've put `zh_cn` translations of structures and dimensions in vanilla Minecraft there as a template, 
and your translations should also follow the same style.
```json
{
  "dimension.minecraft.overworld": "Overworld",
  "structure.minecraft.bastion_remnant": "Bastion Remnant"
}
```
